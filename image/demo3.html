        All civil and track work contracts for the 352-km stretch of the bullet train project on the Gujarat side have now been awarded, with â‚¹ 3,141-crore worth track contract being given to infra giant Larsen and Toubro, Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said on Saturday.
The 508-km bullet train project between Mumbai and Ahmedabad has hit a roadblock in Maharashtra because of land acquisition issues, but work has already started on the Gujarat side of the project.
